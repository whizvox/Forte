### The Forte Project

Welcome one and all! This is the online repository for the pure Java game, Forte.

### What is this?

It's a game. Specifically, it's a rhythm game, whose design and gameplay was largely inspired by [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/) and its scoring inspired by the [Rock Band](http://www.rockband4.com/) series. The concept is simple: click circles to the beat of the song. The more accurate you are, the more points you get, and the higher in rank you soar.

### Running the Project

This is assuming you've successfully cloned the project onto your drive. When in the root directory, just type `gradlew :client:run -Dexec.args="root=run"` to run it in a directory accounted by the `.gitignore`.
